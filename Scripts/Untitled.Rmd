## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
setwd(downloads/carbon-D-glucose.EXCEL)
```

```{r}
carbon_d_glcose<-read.csv("kb|media.5189.csv")
```
```{r}
input<-"glucose"

numberofsimulations<-100

data[, 4] <- sample(-1:-100, nrow(data), replace = TRUE)

i<-1
```

```{r}
i<-1
for (i in 1:numberofsimulations) {
  print(paste0(input,"_simulation_",i))
  
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
