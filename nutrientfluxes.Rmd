## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

DataFolderPath<-"Data/Carbon-D-Glucose.EXCEL"

```
```{r}
carbon_d_glucose <- read.csv(paste0(DataFolderPath,"/kb|media.5189.csv"))
# works
carbon_d_glucose
data <- carbon_d_glucose
```

```{r}
#carbon_d_glucose<-read.csv("kb|media.5189.csv")
data <- carbon_d_glcose
```

```{r}
input <- "glucose"
numberofsimulations <- 1000
for (i in 1:numberofsimulations) {
  print(paste0(input,"_simulation_",i))
  
  
  # replace min flux with random number between 0 and -100
  data[, 4] <- runif(nrow(data), min=-100, max=0)
   data[, 4] <- round(data[, 4])
  # replace max flux with random number between 0 and 100
  data[, 5] <- runif(nrow(data), min=0, max=100)
  data[, 5] <- round(data[, 5])
  # write the randomized dataframe as csv file
  write.csv(data, file=paste0("Output/",input,"_simulation_",i,".csv"),row.names = F)
}


#
```
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# set the folder path to where the CSV files are located
folder_path <- "Output"

# get all CSV files in the folder
file_names <- list.files(folder_path, pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)

# initialize an empty data frame to store all data
df <- data.frame()

# loop through each CSV file and combine into a single data frame
for (file in file_names) {
  # read the CSV file
  temp_df <- read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  
  # combine the data into a single data frame
  df <- rbind(df, temp_df)
}

# convert name column to a factor
df$name <- as.factor(df$name)

# create histograms for each factor of the name column
for (compound in unique(df$name)) {
  # create histograms for min_flux
  ggplot(df[df$name == compound, ], aes(x = as.numeric(min_flux))) +
    geom_histogram() +
    ggtitle(paste0(compound, " - Min Flux"))
  
  # create histograms for max_flux
  ggplot(df[df$name == compound, ], aes(x = as.numeric(max_flux))) +
    geom_histogram() +
    ggtitle(paste0(compound, " - Max Flux"))
}


```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
